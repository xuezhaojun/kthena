## P/D Disaggregated Autoscaling API

### Summary

This proposal redesigns the autoscaling API with two goals:

1. **Merge `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` into `AutoscalingPolicy`** — today users must create two resources (policy + binding) and cross-reference them. Merging eliminates the indirection, removes split configuration across objects, and gives users a single resource that fully describes "what to scale, on what signal, and how."
2. **Add first-class `DisaggregatedTarget`** — replace the generic `SubTarget` mechanism with a purpose-built structure for coordinated multi-role scaling, including independent per-role metrics, per-role metric sources (Pod or Prometheus), replica bounds, and a role-to-role ratio constraint.

The `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` CRD and the `SubTarget` type are removed.

### Motivation

In disaggregated prefill/decode inference architectures, the prefill and decode stages have fundamentally different resource profiles:

- **Prefill** is compute-bound and bursty — it processes the full prompt in one forward pass.
- **Decode** is memory-bandwidth-bound and long-running — it generates tokens auto-regressively.

Scaling these two stages independently is essential for cost-efficient serving. However, independent scaling alone is insufficient — the P/D ratio must be coordinated. Too many prefill replicas starve decode capacity (growing queues); too many decode replicas waste GPU memory on idle KV caches. A healthy system keeps the ratio within an operator-defined range.

**Problems with the current two-resource model (AutoscalingPolicy + AutoscalingPolicyBinding):**

1. **Unnecessary indirection** — the user always creates a 1:1 pair (policy + binding). The binding adds a `policyRef` that points to a policy in the same namespace. This indirection provides no reuse benefit in practice (policies are rarely shared across multiple bindings) and doubles the number of objects to manage.
2. **Configuration split across two resources** — metric targets live in `AutoscalingPolicy.spec.metrics`, while metric retrieval details (`Pod`/`Prometheus` query and endpoint) live in `AutoscalingPolicyBinding.spec.*.target.metricSources`. Users must keep two resources in sync (metric names in policy and map keys in binding), which is error-prone.
3. **Fragmented view** — operators must read two resources to understand the complete autoscaling configuration for a single ModelServing.

**Problems with `SubTarget` for P/D disaggregation:**

1. **No coordination** — each binding scales its target independently; there is no concept of a ratio constraint between prefill and decode.
2. **Fragile coupling** — two bindings must manually agree on `targetRef`, and there is no validation that they reference the same ModelServing.
3. **Generic abstraction** — `SubTarget` is a generic kind/name pair. It provides no schema-level guidance, validation, or defaulting for P/D use cases.

#### Goals

- Merge `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` into `AutoscalingPolicy` to provide a single-resource UX.
- Provide a single `AutoscalingPolicy` resource that drives coordinated P/D scaling for one ModelServing.
- Allow independent `minReplicas` / `maxReplicas` per role to set per-stage capacity boundaries.
- Introduce a `ratioConstraint` so the controller can enforce a healthy role-to-role ratio.
- Support per-role metrics and per-role metric sources, reusing current `MetricSource` semantics (`Pod` and `Prometheus`).
- Remove the `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` CRD and the generic `SubTarget` type.

#### Non-Goals

- Controller implementation and reconciliation loop design (covered separately).
- Multi-ModelServing (heterogeneous hardware) P/D scaling — that remains in `HeterogeneousTarget`.

### Proposal

#### User Stories

##### Story 1: Single-resource autoscaling

As an ML platform operator, I want to define the complete autoscaling configuration — metrics, behavior, and target — in a single `AutoscalingPolicy` resource instead of maintaining a policy and a separate binding that cross-reference each other.

##### Story 2: Independent P/D scaling with ratio guardrails

As an ML platform operator, I deploy a vLLM disaggregated model with prefill and decode roles. I want the autoscaler to scale prefill replicas between 1–8 and decode replicas between 2–16, while always maintaining a P:D ratio between 1:1 and 1:4. This means if I have 2 prefill replicas, the decode replicas must be between 2 and 8.

##### Story 3: Per-role metrics and sources

As a platform engineer, I want each role (for example, prefill/decode now and rerank in the future) to define its own scaling metrics and metric sources independently in one policy.

##### Story 4: Migration from Policy + Binding

As an existing user with an `AutoscalingPolicy` and one or more `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` objects, I want to consolidate into a single `AutoscalingPolicy` resource.

#### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking change: removes `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` CRD | Both CRDs are alpha-level. Provide a migration guide and conversion tooling. The merged API is strictly simpler. |
| Breaking change for users currently using `SubTarget` | `SubTarget` was alpha-level and only used for P/D roles — the replacement `DisaggregatedTarget` is strictly more capable. |
| Loss of policy reuse across bindings | In practice policies are rarely shared. If reuse is needed, users can use templating tools (Helm, Kustomize). The UX win of a single resource outweighs the theoretical reuse loss. |
| Ratio constraint may be unsatisfiable given per-role min/max bounds | The webhook validates `minRatio <= maxRatio`, that both roles exist and differ, and that the range is achievable within the role replica bounds at admission. See [Validation Rules](#validation-rules-crd--webhook). |
| Increased controller complexity | Ratio enforcement is a bounded constraint-satisfaction problem; design details are deferred to the controller proposal. |

### Design Details

#### API Changes Overview

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Delete `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` CRD | All target/binding fields move into `AutoscalingPolicy`. |
| Delete `SubTarget` type | Replaced by `DisaggregatedTarget`. |
| Expand `AutoscalingPolicySpec` | Add target fields (`homogeneousTarget`, `heterogeneousTarget`, `disaggregatedTarget`) directly. `spec.metrics` (uniform, applies to all roles) and per-role `metrics` are mutually exclusive. |
| Preserve `MetricSource` model | Keep current `MetricSource` discriminated union (`Pod` / `Prometheus`) and move per-target/per-role `metricSources` into `AutoscalingPolicy`. |
| Add `DisaggregatedTarget` | New first-class multi-role scaling type with `roles` and a single `ratioConstraint`. |
| Simplify `Target` | Remove `SubTarget` field. |

##### 1. Merged `AutoscalingPolicy`

```go
// AutoscalingPolicySpec defines the desired state of AutoscalingPolicy.
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="(has(self.heterogeneousTarget) ? 1 : 0) + (has(self.homogeneousTarget) ? 1 : 0) + (has(self.disaggregatedTarget) ? 1 : 0) == 1",message="Exactly one of heterogeneousTarget, homogeneousTarget, or disaggregatedTarget must be set."
type AutoscalingPolicySpec struct {
    // ...

    // --- Target (exactly one must be set) ---
    // HomogeneousTarget enables traditional metric-based scaling for a
    // single ModelServing deployment (whole-deployment granularity).
    // +optional
    HomogeneousTarget *HomogeneousTarget `json:"homogeneousTarget,omitempty"`

    // HeterogeneousTarget enables optimization-based scaling across multiple
    // ModelServing deployments with different hardware capabilities.
    // +optional
    HeterogeneousTarget *HeterogeneousTarget `json:"heterogeneousTarget,omitempty"`

    // DisaggregatedTarget enables coordinated autoscaling of roles
    // within a single ModelServing that uses disaggregated serving.
    // +optional
    DisaggregatedTarget *DisaggregatedTarget `json:"disaggregatedTarget,omitempty"`
}
```

##### 2. Remove `SubTarget` and simplify `Target`

Delete the `SubTarget` struct. `Target` is simplified to:

```go
// Target defines a ModelServing deployment that can be monitored and scaled.
type Target struct {
    // TargetRef references the target object to be monitored and scaled.
    TargetRef corev1.ObjectReference `json:"targetRef"`
    // MetricSources declares how to fetch specific metrics for this target.
    // Keys must match AutoscalingPolicy.spec.metrics[].name.
    // Missing keys are treated as missing metrics for that reconcile loop.
    // For example, a key "podinfo_rps" here must correspond to a metric named
    // "podinfo_rps" in the referenced AutoscalingPolicy.
    // +optional
    MetricSources map[string]MetricSource `json:"metricSources,omitempty"`
}
```

`Target` remains in use by `HomogeneousTarget` (whole-ModelServing scaling) and `HeterogeneousTarget` (multi-ModelServing optimization). Both operate at the ModelServing level; `SubTarget` was primarily used for role-level scaling (e.g., P/D), which is superseded by `DisaggregatedTarget` in this proposal.

##### 2.1 Preserve `MetricSource` and Prometheus semantics

The merged API keeps the existing metric-source model from `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` unchanged:

- `MetricSource.pod` for direct pod scraping (`name`/`uri`/`port`/`labelSelector`)
- `MetricSource.prometheus` for external Prometheus query (`serverURL` + `query`)

`PrometheusMetricSource.auth` remains part of the API surface and continues to be reserved for follow-up runtime implementation, same as today.

##### 3. `DisaggregatedTarget` and supporting types

```go
// DisaggregatedTarget defines coordinated autoscaling for disaggregated
// serving roles within a single ModelServing deployment.
type DisaggregatedTarget struct {
    // TargetRef references the ModelServing deployment that contains
    // all scalable roles.
    TargetRef corev1.ObjectReference `json:"targetRef"`

    // Roles defines per-role scaling parameters. The map key is roleName
    // from ModelServing.spec.template.roles[].name.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinProperties=2
    Roles map[string]RoleScalingParam `json:"roles"`

    // RatioConstraint defines the acceptable ratio range of a single role pair.
    // It enforces:
    //   minRatio <= replicas[numeratorRole] / replicas[denominatorRole] <= maxRatio
    // when denominator replica is non-zero.
    //
    // +optional
    RatioConstraint *RoleRatioConstraint `json:"ratioConstraint,omitempty"`
}

// RoleScalingParam defines the scaling configuration for one role.
type RoleScalingParam struct {
    // MinReplicas defines the minimum number of replicas for this role.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
    MinReplicas int32 `json:"minReplicas"`

    // MaxReplicas defines the maximum number of replicas for this role.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
    MaxReplicas int32 `json:"maxReplicas"`

    // Metrics defines the list of metrics used to evaluate scaling decisions
    // for this role, allowing different roles to scale on different signals.
    //
    // spec.metrics (policy-level) and per-role metrics are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE:
    // either set spec.metrics to scale every role on the same signals, or set
    // metrics on every role here and leave spec.metrics empty. They must not
    // both be set (see Validation Rules).
    // +optional
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=1
    Metrics []AutoscalingPolicyMetric `json:"metrics,omitempty"`

    // MetricSources declares how each metric is fetched for this role.
    // Keys must match role-level metrics when present, otherwise top-level
    // spec.metrics[].name.
    // Missing keys are treated as missing metrics for that reconcile loop.
    // +optional
    MetricSources map[string]MetricSource `json:"metricSources,omitempty"`
}

// RoleRatioConstraint defines the acceptable ratio range between two roles.
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self.minRatio <= self.maxRatio",message="minRatio must be <= maxRatio"
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self.numeratorRole != self.denominatorRole",message="numeratorRole and denominatorRole must differ"
type RoleRatioConstraint struct {
    // NumeratorRole is the role on the numerator side of the ratio.
    NumeratorRole string `json:"numeratorRole"`

    // DenominatorRole is the role on the denominator side of the ratio.
    DenominatorRole string `json:"denominatorRole"`

    // MinRatio is the minimum allowed value of
    // replicas[numeratorRole] / replicas[denominatorRole].
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
    MinRatio resource.Quantity `json:"minRatio"`

    // MaxRatio is the maximum allowed value of
    // replicas[numeratorRole] / replicas[denominatorRole].
    MaxRatio resource.Quantity `json:"maxRatio"`
}
```

> **Why `resource.Quantity` for ratios?** Kubernetes does not support native `float` fields in CRDs. `resource.Quantity` is the idiomatic way to express decimal values in the Kubernetes API (e.g., `"0.25"`, `"1"`, `"2.5"`). It avoids floating-point imprecision and is already used throughout the Kubernetes and Kthena APIs for similar purposes.
>
> **Caveat**: `resource.Quantity` carries unit/suffix semantics (e.g., `"250m"` is parsed as `0.25`), which can be surprising when the value is meant as a pure ratio. An integer-pair representation that avoids this ambiguity is discussed in [Alternative 5](#alternative-5-integer-pair-ratio-instead-of-resourcequantity).

##### 4. `HomogeneousTarget` (unchanged, except `SubTarget` removed from `Target`)

```go
type HomogeneousTarget struct {
    // Target defines the object to be monitored and scaled.
    Target Target `json:"target,omitempty"`
    // MinReplicas defines the minimum number of replicas to maintain.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
    MinReplicas int32 `json:"minReplicas"`
    // MaxReplicas defines the maximum number of replicas allowed.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
    MaxReplicas int32 `json:"maxReplicas"`
}
```

##### 5. Delete `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` CRD

The entire `AutoscalingPolicyBinding`, `AutoscalingPolicyBindingSpec`, `AutoscalingPolicyBindingStatus`, and `AutoscalingPolicyBindingList` types are removed. The `policyRef` indirection is eliminated.

##### 6. `AutoscalingPolicyStatus`

Because the target now lives in `AutoscalingPolicy` itself (previously the binding carried the binding-side status), `AutoscalingPolicy` needs a status subresource that reports the observed scaling state. This is especially important for `DisaggregatedTarget`, where the user must be able to observe the current per-role replica counts, the actual P/D ratio, and whether the ratio constraint forced an adjustment.

```go
// AutoscalingPolicyStatus defines the observed state of AutoscalingPolicy.
type AutoscalingPolicyStatus struct {
    // ObservedGeneration is the most recent generation observed by the controller.
    // +optional
    ObservedGeneration int64 `json:"observedGeneration,omitempty"`

    // Conditions represents the latest available observations of the policy's state.
    // Well-known condition types include:
    //   - "Ready":                   the policy is actively reconciled.
    //   - "TargetFound":             the referenced ModelServing (and roles) exist.
    //   - "RatioConstraintViolated": the desired counts could not satisfy ratioConstraint
    //                                given the per-role min/max bounds.
    // +optional
    // +listType=map
    // +listMapKey=type
    Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`

    // HomogeneousStatus reports the observed state when HomogeneousTarget is used.
    // +optional
    HomogeneousStatus *TargetScalingStatus `json:"homogeneousStatus,omitempty"`

    // DisaggregatedStatus reports the observed state when DisaggregatedTarget is used.
    // +optional
    DisaggregatedStatus *DisaggregatedScalingStatus `json:"disaggregatedStatus,omitempty"`

    // HeterogeneousStatus reports the per-target observed state when
    // HeterogeneousTarget is used.
    // +optional
    HeterogeneousStatus []TargetScalingStatus `json:"heterogeneousStatus,omitempty"`
}

// TargetScalingStatus reports the observed scaling state of a single scalable
// unit (a whole ModelServing, or one role within it).
type TargetScalingStatus struct {
    // Name identifies the unit. For HomogeneousTarget it is the ModelServing
    // name; for a role it is the role name.
    Name string `json:"name"`

    // CurrentReplicas is the number of replicas currently observed.
    CurrentReplicas int32 `json:"currentReplicas"`

    // DesiredReplicas is the number of replicas the controller computed from
    // metrics, before ratio enforcement.
    DesiredReplicas int32 `json:"desiredReplicas"`

    // Mode reports whether the unit is currently in "Stable" or "Panic" mode.
    // +optional
    Mode string `json:"mode,omitempty"`

    // LastScaleTime is the last time the unit was scaled by the controller.
    // +optional
    LastScaleTime *metav1.Time `json:"lastScaleTime,omitempty"`
}

// DisaggregatedScalingStatus reports the observed state of a DisaggregatedTarget.
//
// Example: a prefill/decode target whose metrics asked for prefill=6, decode=2,
// but the ratioConstraint prefill/decode <= 1 forced decode up to 6:
//
//   disaggregatedStatus:
//     roles:
//       - name: prefill
//         currentReplicas: 6
//         desiredReplicas: 6        # metric-derived, kept as-is
//       - name: decode
//         currentReplicas: 6
//         desiredReplicas: 2        # metric asked for 2, ratio raised it to 6
//     ratioStatus:
//       numeratorRole: prefill
//       denominatorRole: decode
//       currentRatio: "1"         # 6/6, within [0.25, 1]
//     ratioAdjusted: true           # decode was overridden to satisfy the ratio
type DisaggregatedScalingStatus struct {
    // Roles reports the observed scaling state per role.
    Roles []TargetScalingStatus `json:"roles"`

    // RatioStatus reports the observed value of the configured ratio constraint.
    // +optional
    RatioStatus *RoleRatioStatus `json:"ratioStatus,omitempty"`

    // RatioAdjusted is true when the most recent reconcile had to override the
    // metric-derived replica counts to satisfy the ratio constraint.
    // +optional
    RatioAdjusted bool `json:"ratioAdjusted,omitempty"`
}

// RoleRatioStatus reports the observed value for the ratio constraint.
type RoleRatioStatus struct {
    NumeratorRole   string `json:"numeratorRole"`
    DenominatorRole string `json:"denominatorRole"`
    CurrentRatio    string `json:"currentRatio,omitempty"`
}
```

Recommended printer columns for `kubectl get autoscalingpolicy`:

| Column | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `ROLES` | `len(status.disaggregatedStatus.roles)` |
| `RATIO` | `status.disaggregatedStatus.ratioStatus.currentRatio` |
| `READY` | `status.conditions[type=Ready].status` |

##### Homogeneous scaling (single resource, before vs. after)

Before (two resources):

```yaml
apiVersion: workload.serving.volcano.sh/v1alpha1
kind: AutoscalingPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  tolerancePercent: 10
  metrics:
    - name: num_requests_waiting
      targetValue: "5"
  behavior: { ... }
---
apiVersion: workload.serving.volcano.sh/v1alpha1
kind: AutoscalingPolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: my-binding
spec:
  policyRef:
    name: my-policy
  homogeneousTarget:
    target:
      targetRef:
        kind: ModelServing
        name: my-model
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
```

After (single resource):

```yaml
apiVersion: workload.serving.volcano.sh/v1alpha1
kind: AutoscalingPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  tolerancePercent: 10
  metrics:
    - name: num_requests_waiting
      targetValue: "5"
  behavior: { ... }
  homogeneousTarget:
    target:
      targetRef:
        kind: ModelServing
        name: my-model
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
```

#### Validation Rules (CRD + Webhook)

| Rule | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Exactly one of `homogeneousTarget`, `heterogeneousTarget`, `disaggregatedTarget` must be set. | `AutoscalingPolicySpec` (CEL) |
| `spec.metrics` and per-role `metrics` are mutually exclusive: set `spec.metrics` (uniform) **or** set `metrics` on every role, never both. | `AutoscalingPolicySpec` / `DisaggregatedTarget` (webhook) |
| Whichever metrics list is used (`spec.metrics` or each role's `metrics`) must have at least one entry. | `AutoscalingPolicySpec` / `RoleScalingParam` |
| `metricSources` keys must be a subset of the effective metric names for that scope. | `Target` / `RoleScalingParam` |
| For each `MetricSource`, `type`/backend pairing must be valid (`Pod` -> `pod`, `Prometheus` -> `prometheus`). | `MetricSource` (CEL, preserved) |
| `targetRef.kind` must be `ModelServing`. | `DisaggregatedTarget` |
| `roles` map keys must reference existing roles in the referenced ModelServing and contain at least two entries. | `DisaggregatedTarget` |
| `minReplicas <= maxReplicas` for each role. | `RoleScalingParam` |
| If `ratioConstraint` is set: `numeratorRole != denominatorRole`, both roles exist in `roles`, and `minRatio <= maxRatio`. | `RoleRatioConstraint` (CEL) |
| If `ratioConstraint` is set, bounds must be achievable given role min/max replicas: `numerator.minReplicas / denominator.maxReplicas <= maxRatio` **and** `numerator.maxReplicas / denominator.minReplicas >= minRatio` (when `denominator.minReplicas > 0`). | `DisaggregatedTarget` |
| If `ratioConstraint` is set, the two referenced roles must be scalable-to-zero together: `roles[numeratorRole].minReplicas == 0` **iff** `roles[denominatorRole].minReplicas == 0`. | `DisaggregatedTarget` (CEL) |
| `minRatio` / `maxRatio` must not carry a unit suffix (e.g., reject `"250m"`). | `RoleRatioConstraint` |

#### Scaling Semantics (Controller Contract)

> **Note**: Controller implementation is out of scope for this proposal. These semantics define the contract the controller must honor.

1. **Effective metrics per role**: `spec.metrics` and per-role `metrics` are mutually exclusive. When `spec.metrics` is set, every role is evaluated against that shared list; when per-role `metrics` are set, each role is evaluated against its own list. The controller computes a desired replica count for each role independently.
2. **Multiple metrics combine by max**: When a role's effective list contains more than one metric, the controller computes a desired count for each metric independently and takes the **maximum** (the standard HPA rule), so the most demanding signal wins. For example, if `pending_requests` implies 1 replica but `num_requests_waiting` implies 10, the role scales to 10. This removes any ambiguity when two metrics disagree.
3. **Metric source resolution**: For each effective metric name, the controller resolves `MetricSource` in this order: role-level `metricSources`, then target-level/default semantics. Resolved sources can be pod scraping or Prometheus query.
4. **Per-role clamping**: Each desired count is clamped to `[minReplicas, maxReplicas]` of the corresponding role.
5. **Coupled scale-to-zero**: When `ratioConstraint` is set, the two roles it references must reach zero together. The controller does not evaluate the ratio while either side is `0`.
6. **Ratio enforcement**: For the configured role pair, when both roles are non-zero, after clamping the controller adjusts replica counts to satisfy `minRatio <= replicas[numeratorRole]/replicas[denominatorRole] <= maxRatio` (see [Ratio Enforcement Algorithm](#ratio-enforcement-algorithm)).
7. **Atomic patch**: The controller patches both affected `spec.template.roles[*].replicas` in a single ModelServing update to avoid transient states that violate the ratio constraint.

#### Ratio Enforcement Algorithm

The webhook rejects an infeasible `ratioConstraint` at admission (see [Validation Rules](#validation-rules-crd--webhook)), so the controller always starts from a constraint whose feasible region is **non-empty**. Enforcement therefore reduces to *projecting* the two metric-derived replica counts into that region — never a search that might fail:

1. **Start from clamped desire**: take `desired[numeratorRole]` and `desired[denominatorRole]`, each already clamped to its own `[minReplicas, maxReplicas]`.
2. **Skip when either side is zero**: if either role resolved to `0`, the ratio is not evaluated (see coupled scale-to-zero above).
3. **Scale-up–biased repair**: if the pair violates the range, fix it by *increasing* the deficient role rather than shrinking the other, so capacity is never reduced below what metrics asked for:
   - if `num/den < minRatio`: raise `num` to `ceil(minRatio · den)`; if that exceeds `maxReplicas(num)`, instead lower `den` to `floor(num / minRatio)`.
   - if `num/den > maxRatio`: raise `den` to `ceil(num / maxRatio)`; if that exceeds `maxReplicas(den)`, instead lower `num` to `floor(maxRatio · den)`.
4. **Report**: set `status.disaggregatedStatus.ratioAdjusted = true` when the repair changed any metric-derived count, and record the resulting ratio in `status.disaggregatedStatus.ratioStatus`.

Because the admission webhook guarantees a non-empty integer feasible region within the role replica bounds, the single-pair projection always succeeds in one pass. This biases the result toward the smallest replica vector that is **≥ metric demand** and satisfies the constraint, so SLOs are protected at the cost of a few extra replicas rather than risking under-provisioning.

#### Migration

##### From `AutoscalingPolicy` + `AutoscalingPolicyBinding`

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `AutoscalingPolicy` with metrics + behavior | Same fields stay in `AutoscalingPolicy.spec` |
| `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` with `policyRef` + target | Target fields (including `metricSources` with `Pod`/`Prometheus`) move into `AutoscalingPolicy.spec`; `policyRef` is deleted |
| Two resources per scaling config | One resource |

##### From `SubTarget` P/D bindings

| Before (policy + two bindings with SubTarget) | After (single policy) |
|---|---|
| Policy: metrics + behavior | `spec.metrics` + `spec.behavior` (same policy) |
| Binding A: `homogeneousTarget.target.subTargets: {kind: Role, name: prefill}` | `spec.disaggregatedTarget.roles.prefill` |
| Binding B: `homogeneousTarget.target.subTargets: {kind: Role, name: decode}` | `spec.disaggregatedTarget.roles.decode` |
| 3 resources, no ratio coordination | 1 resource, `ratioConstraint` provides coordination |

### Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Keep `AutoscalingPolicyBinding` as a separate CRD

Keep the current two-resource model and only add `DisaggregatedTarget` to the binding.

**Rejected because**: The policy/binding split provides no practical benefit — policies are not shared across bindings. It keeps metric targets and metric retrieval sources in different resources, increases the number of objects to manage, and makes the complete autoscaling configuration harder to read. Merging into one resource is simpler for both users and the controller.

#### Alternative 2: Keep `SubTarget` and add ratio annotation

Add a `volcano.sh/pd-ratio-range` annotation to coordinate two separate bindings.

**Rejected because**: Annotations are untyped, unvalidated, and invisible to schema tooling. Coordination between two separate resources via annotations is fragile and hard to reason about.

#### Alternative 3: Generic `roles[]` list instead of `roles` map

```go
type DisaggregatedTarget struct {
    TargetRef  corev1.ObjectReference `json:"targetRef"`
    Roles      []RoleScalingParam     `json:"roles"`
    RatioConstraint *RoleRatioConstraint `json:"ratioConstraint,omitempty"`
}
```

**Rejected because**: a list weakens key-based validation and makes patch/update operations harder (rename and merge semantics are less stable than map keys). `roles` map uses roleName as the canonical key and works better with ratio constraints that reference roles by name.

#### Alternative 4: Extend `HomogeneousTarget` with optional P/D fields

Add `prefill` and `decode` fields inside `HomogeneousTarget`.

**Rejected because**: `HomogeneousTarget` is inherently single-target. Embedding P/D semantics overloads its purpose and creates confusing validation rules (e.g., `minReplicas`/`maxReplicas` at top level vs. per-role). A separate target type is cleaner.

#### Alternative 5: Integer-pair ratio instead of `resource.Quantity`

Express each ratio bound as an explicit numerator/denominator integer pair rather than a single decimal `resource.Quantity`:

```go
// RoleRatio expresses a role-to-role ratio as an integer pair N:D.
// For example, {Numerator: 1, Denominator: 4} means ratio = 1:4 (0.25).
type RoleRatio struct {
    // Numerator is the numerator side of the ratio.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
    Numerator int32 `json:"numerator"`
    // Denominator is the denominator side of the ratio.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    Denominator int32 `json:"denominator"`
}

// RoleRatioConstraintIntPair defines the role-pair ratio constraint.
type RoleRatioConstraintIntPair struct {
    NumeratorRole   string    `json:"numeratorRole"`
    DenominatorRole string    `json:"denominatorRole"`
    MinRatio        RoleRatio `json:"minRatio"`
    MaxRatio        RoleRatio `json:"maxRatio"`
}
```

Example YAML:

```yaml
    ratioConstraint:
      numeratorRole: prefill
      denominatorRole: decode
      minRatio:                # P:D >= 1:4
        numerator: 1
        denominator: 4
      maxRatio:                # P:D <= 1:1
        numerator: 1
        denominator: 1
```

**Pros**:

- **No unit ambiguity** — integers cannot be misread the way `resource.Quantity` interprets suffixes (`"250m"` → `0.25`), removing a class of user error.
- **Directly mirrors how operators reason** — people think and communicate in terms of "1:4", not "0.25".
- **Exact comparison** — ratio checks become cross-multiplication of integers (`p1*d2 <= p2*d1`), avoiding any decimal parsing or rounding entirely.

**Cons**:

- **Two fields per bound** instead of one — slightly more verbose YAML.
- **Diverges from existing convention** — `AutoscalingPolicyMetric.TargetValue` and other Kthena fields already use `resource.Quantity` for decimal values, so the integer pair would be the odd one out.
- **CEL validation is marginally more complex** — comparisons require cross-multiplication rather than a direct `<=`.

**Decision**: The proposal uses `resource.Quantity` for consistency with the rest of the Kthena API, mitigating the unit-ambiguity concern through documentation and webhook validation (rejecting values with non-empty suffixes). The integer-pair form is recorded here as a viable alternative should the unit ambiguity prove to be a frequent source of user error in practice.
