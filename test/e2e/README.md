# E2E Tests for Kthena

This directory contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the Kthena project using Kind (Kubernetes in Docker).

## Overview

The E2E tests use helm to install kthena into a Kind cluster and verify core functionality. Tests are organized into categories that can run in parallel on CI.

## Test Categories

| Category | Description | Make Target |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `controller-manager` | ModelServing, ModelBooster, Autoscaling | `make test-e2e-controller-manager` |
| `router` | ModelRoute without Gateway API | `make test-e2e-router` |
| `gateway-api` | ModelRoute with Gateway API | `make test-e2e-gateway-api` |
| `gateway-inference-extension` | HTTPRoute, InferencePool | `make test-e2e-gateway-inference-extension` |

## Prerequisites

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) must be installed
- Go 1.24
- Docker (required by Kind)
- Helm (required to install helm charts)

## Test Environment

The tests create a Kind cluster with the following characteristics:

- **Cluster Name**: `kthena-e2e` (can be overridden with `CLUSTER_NAME` env var)
- **Kubernetes Version**: v1.31.0
- **Test Namespace**: `dev`

## CI Behavior

The GitHub Actions E2E workflow runs the same category targets in parallel by using a matrix:

| CI Job | Make Target | Cluster Name |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `E2E (controller-manager)` | `make test-e2e-controller-manager` | `kthena-controller-manager` |
| `E2E (router)` | `make test-e2e-router` | `kthena-router` |
| `E2E (gateway-api)` | `make test-e2e-gateway-api` | `kthena-gateway-api` |
| `E2E (gateway-inference-extension)` | `make test-e2e-gateway-inference-extension` | `kthena-gateway-inference-extension` |

The workflow only runs for pull requests that touch runtime, chart, test, or E2E workflow paths. Documentation-only changes outside those paths should not trigger this workflow.

Each category installs only the external CRDs it needs:

| Category | Additional CRDs |
|----------|-----------------|
| `controller-manager` | LeaderWorkerSet |
| `router` | None |
| `gateway-api` | Gateway API |
| `gateway-inference-extension` | Gateway API and Gateway API Inference Extension |
| `all` | Gateway API, Gateway API Inference Extension, and LeaderWorkerSet |

## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests (Legacy)

```bash
make test-e2e
make test-e2e-cleanup
```

### Run Specific Category

```bash
# Controller manager tests
make test-e2e-controller-manager

# Router tests (no Gateway API)
make test-e2e-router

# Gateway API tests
make test-e2e-gateway-api

# Gateway Inference Extension tests
make test-e2e-gateway-inference-extension

# Cleanup after any test
make test-e2e-cleanup
```

### Reproduce a CI Category Locally

To reproduce one CI matrix entry locally, use the same cluster name pattern as the workflow:

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME=kthena-gateway-api make test-e2e-gateway-api
CLUSTER_NAME=kthena-gateway-api make test-e2e-cleanup
```

Replace `gateway-api` with the category that failed in CI.

### Environment Variables

- `CLUSTER_NAME`: Override Kind cluster name (default: `kthena-e2e`)
- `TEST_CATEGORY`: Specify which CRDs to install (used by setup.sh)
- `HUB`: Docker image registry (default: `ghcr.io/volcano-sh`)
- `TAG`: Docker image tag (default: `latest`)

## Local Testing Considerations

### CPU Limitations (AVX-512)

Some E2E tests (e.g., `TestModelCR` in `model_booster_test.go`) use vLLM-based images (`ghcr.io/huntersman/vllm-cpu-env:latest`).

**Important:** The official vLLM CPU backend relies heavily on the **AVX-512** instruction set.

- **Linux Servers:** Most modern server-grade CPUs (Intel Xeon Scalable, AMD EPYC "Genoa") support AVX-512.
- **Laptops/Intel Macs:** Most consumer-grade Intel CPUs (especially older ones or 12th+ Gen Core where Intel disabled AVX-512) **do not** support it.
- **Apple Silicon:** Architecture mismatch (ARM64 vs x86_64).

If you run these tests on an incompatible machine, the vLLM containers may crash with `SIGILL` (Illegal Instruction). For more details, see the [vLLM CPU installation guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/cpu/).

### Running Non-vLLM Tests Locally

Tests that do not require the vLLM image (like webhook validation/mutation tests) can be executed locally even without AVX-512 support.

For example, to run the controller manager webhook tests:

```bash
go test -v ./test/e2e/controller-manager/ -run TestWebhook
```

## Troubleshooting

### One CI Category Failed

A failure in one matrix category does not always mean the pull request changed that component. First check whether the PR touched one of the E2E workflow trigger paths, then inspect the failing category logs and uploaded `e2e-logs-*` artifact.

Common first checks:

- Confirm the failing test package from the last `FAIL` line.
- Check whether the test reached cleanup; cleanup logs usually appear after the package failure.
- If only one category failed and the PR does not touch that area, rerun the failed job before changing code.
- For Gateway API failures, confirm the Gateway API CRDs were installed successfully during `setup.sh`.

### Cleanup Left a Cluster Behind

If a local run exits before cleanup, remove the category cluster directly:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name kthena-gateway-api
```
